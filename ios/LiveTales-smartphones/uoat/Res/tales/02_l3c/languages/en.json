  "title":"The Three Little Pigs",
  "idText01":"Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who were brothers. One day, they decided it was time they left their parents' house.",
  "idText02":"\"We're going to build a house each!\" they said cheerfully as they set off.",
  "idText03":"The first pig was a bit lazy. He quickly made a house from straw so he could take a nap as soon as possible.",
  "idText04":"\"No need to make such a big effort and work so much\" he thought just before he fell asleep.",
  "idText05":"The second pig was very hungry, so he spent some time constructing his house from wood and then had something to eat.",
  "idText06":"In the meantime, the third pig had been fetching heavy bricks...",
  "idText07":"... and was still working on his house even hours after his brothers had finished theirs.",
  "idText08":"But watch out! The pigs hadn't noticed that there was a wolf strolling around the place in which they had built their houses.",
  "idText09":"\"Hmm... My new neighbours look delicious!\", the wolf thought and licked his lips.",
  "idText10":"First he went to the straw cottage and shouted at the lazy pig \"Open the door or I'll blow down your house!\"",
  "idText11":"As nobody opened the door, the wolf started blowing and... the house came down in no time.",
  "idText12":"The poor pig ran off to take shelter in his brother's wooden house.",
  "idText13":"Now it was this house the wolf was after. \"Open the door or I'll blow down this house, too!\", shouted the wolf. But nobody opened.",
  "idText14":"The wooden house resisted the wolf's blows a bit longer than the first house, but in the end it toppled, too.",
  "idText15":"The two brothers dashed to hide in their brother's house of brick.",
  "idText16":"The wolf got to the last house and asked the three little pigs who were hiding inside: \"Are you not going to open this door, either?\"",
  "idText17":"Of course the pigs did not open the door. And so the wolf started blowing, and he blew, and blew, until he turned bright red...",
  "idText18":"... but the brick house withstood the wolf's blowing until he felt too weak to go on.",
  "idText19":"\"There's no way I'm letting these pigs get away!\", the wolf growled. \"There must be a place to enter\", he thought.",
  "idText20":"So he climbed to the roof to try and sneak in by the chimney.",
  "idText21":"The wolf was convinced that his idea was very clever, but he didn't know the pigs had expected it...",
  "idText22":"... and had put a pot of boiling water in the chimney. \"Ouch!\", the wolf yelled out in pain.",
  "idText23":"And this is how the three little pigs managed to chase away the wolf.",
  "idText24":"It did mean a greater effort to build the brick house, but in the end it was where the pigs lived safe and happy!"
